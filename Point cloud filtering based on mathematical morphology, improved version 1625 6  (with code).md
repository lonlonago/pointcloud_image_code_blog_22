#  First, the idea 

>  The initial method uses real data for calculation. In fact, you can learn from the idea of pointers in C language. You only need to record the index of each point, and you don't need the x, y, and z of each point to participate in the calculation. In addition, you have learned some problems with the syntax performance in MATLAB, and the effect will be much better than before. About 200,000 points can complete the expansion and corrosion operations in a very short time.
