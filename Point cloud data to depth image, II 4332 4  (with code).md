#  I. Introduction 

>  I have used the generating depth image function in PCL before, and I want to use MATLAB to achieve a similar function. The whole process is a sampling process of rotating horizontal and vertical angles, as shown in the figure below (for details, you can also refer to the depth image to point cloud data (lidar data)). The final result can be determined by the row number and column number. The specific calculation process can be read in the code.
