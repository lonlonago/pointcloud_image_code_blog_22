#  I. Introduction 

>  In a two-dimensional plane, the extremum points in any direction of the point cloud need to be determined by the extremum of the polynomial ax + by. Here a and b can be any real numbers. If we want to obtain the extremum points in the upper left, upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right directions, we actually take a and b as 0 and Â± 1. I feel that this way of obtaining the extremum points is very interesting, so I implemented it.
